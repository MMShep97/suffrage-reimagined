        <div class="text-left">
            <div>The period from 1870 to 1890 was one of both excitement and disappointment for Iowa suffragists. When
                Iowa’s constitution was adopted in 1857, the word “white” was included in the voting section, but in
                1868, Iowans voted to remove it, enfranchising black and Native American men in law, if not always in
                practice.</div>
            <div>This dramatic change in just over a decade led women to believe they would be next. Indeed, in 1870,
                the Iowa Legislature hired a female clerk (Mary Spencer), changed the code so women could practice law,
                and approved a resolution to amend the constitution and allow women to vote.</div>
            <div>Quaker and peace activist Joseph Dugdale spearheaded a women’s rights convention in Mount Pleasant in
                1870, which led to the organization of the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association (later known as the Iowa
                Equal Suffrage Association). A Mount Pleasant Journal editorial encouraged other states to look to Iowa
                as an example of progress.</div>
            <div>In 1871, a free love scandal rocked the nation and splintered the suffrage movement in Iowa. The 1872
                General Assembly rejected the women’s suffrage resolution - forcing the women to start over in the
                legislature.</div>
            <div>
                Meanwhile, more and more Iowa women began speaking publicly and getting involved in local, state, and
                national suffrage organizations.

            <div>Trying to gain political power from outside the political arena can be a difficult process - as the
                Iowa suffragists found out.</div>

            <div>The women had to rely on male lawmakers and male voters to enact legislative change. In 1897, Susan B.
                Anthony said the Iowa General Assembly was playing a “cat and mouse” game with suffragists. The cat and
                mouse game that began in the late 1860s would continue for several decades: a women’s suffrage amendment
                was considered in almost every session from 1870 to 1916, but did not pass two consecutive sessions
                until 1916</div>

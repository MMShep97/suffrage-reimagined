          <p>The period from <strong>1870</strong> to <strong>1890</strong> was one of both excitement and
            disappointment
            for Iowa suffragists. When Iowa&#8217;s constitution was adopted in <strong>1857</strong>, the word
            &ldquo;white&rdquo; was included in the voting section, but in <strong>1868</strong>, Iowans voted to remove
            it, enfranchising black and Native American men in law, if not always in practice. </p>
          <p>This dramatic change in just over a decade led women to believe they would be next. Indeed, in
            <strong>1870</strong>, the Iowa Legislature hired a female clerk (Mary Spencer), changed the code so women
            could practice law, and approved a resolution to amend the constitution and allow women to vote.</p>
          <p>Quaker and peace activist Joseph Dugdale spearheaded a women&#8217;s rights convention in Mount Pleasant in
            <strong>1870</strong>, which led to the organization of the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association (later known as
            the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association). A <em>Mount Pleasant Journal</em> editorial encouraged other states to
            look to Iowa as an example of progress. </p>

          <p>In <strong>1871</strong>, a free love scandal rocked the nation and splintered the suffrage movement in
            Iowa.
            The <strong>1872</strong> General Assembly rejected the womenâ€™s suffrage resolution - forcing the women to
            start over in the legislature.</p>
          <div class="p-spacer"></div>
          <p>Meanwhile, more and more Iowa women began speaking publicly and getting involved in local, state, and
            national suffrage organizations. </p>

            <div>The period from 1854 to 1869 marked the beginning of the suffrage movement in Iowa. Suffrage activity
                before the Civil War was sporadic. Iowa had gained statehood in 1846 and was still very much a pioneer
                state.</div>

            <br />

            <div>Many future suffragists settled in Iowa during the 1850s. In 1854, Frances Dana Gage (1808-1884), a
                women’s rights advocate from Ohio, visited southeastern Iowa to lecture on women’s suffrage.</div>

                This book of Readings and Recitations contained a collection of state and national suffrage poems, songs
                and essays published in 1892 in Des Moines. Such collections may have been sent out by a national
                suffrage organization and modified to appeal to audiences in particular states.

                In an era when women had few leadership or career opportunities outside the home, Iowa’s property and
                marriage laws were considered more favorable than those of other states. In 1868, African Americans won
                the right to vote in Iowa and early suffragists thought women would be next.

                In 1869, members of a women’s study club in Dubuque attended a suffrage convention in Galena, Illinois.
                Soon after, they founded the Northern Iowa Woman Suffrage Association, which was the first organization
                dedicated solely to equal suffrage in the state.

                In the early 1880s, Julia Ward Howe (nationally known social activist and author of the lyrics to The
                Battle Hymn of the Republic) visited Dubuque and gave a report on a Washington, D.C. suffrage convention
                to the Dubuque women.

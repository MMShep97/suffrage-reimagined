                <div class="content"><p> The period from <strong>1854</strong> to <strong>1869</strong> marked the beginning of the suffrage movement in Iowa. Suffrage activity before the Civil War was sporadic. Iowa had gained statehood in <strong>1846</strong> and was still very much a pioneer state. </p>
                <p>Many future suffragists settled in Iowa during the <strong>1850s</strong>. In <strong>1854</strong>, Frances Dana Gage (1808-1884), a women&#8217;s rights advocate from Ohio, visited southeastern Iowa to lecture on women&#8217;s suffrage. </p></div>

                This book of Readings and Recitations contained a collection of state and national suffrage poems, songs and essays published in 1892 in Des Moines. Such collections may have been sent out by a national suffrage organization and modified to appeal to audiences in particular states.

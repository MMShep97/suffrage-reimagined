            African American Women
        </h4>
        Beginning in the early <b>1900s</b>, African American Iowans worked for suffrage mainly through women’s clubs. Founded
        in <b>1902</b>, the Iowa Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (IACWC - later known as the Iowa Federation of Colored
        Women’s Clubs) provided an umbrella organization for the activism of clubwomen.

                By the <b>1910s</b>, suffrage clubs in IACWC included the Suffragette Club of Des Moines and various Mary
                Church Terrell clubs. The IACWC established a standing suffrage committee in <b>1914</b> headed by Teresa Adams
                of Davenport.

                In <b>1916</b>, African American women in Buxton, Iowa marched for suffrage in a family parade.

                Organizations such as IACWC focused on many inequalities facing African American women in areas such as
                education, working wages and property rights.

                Officers of the Des Moines Suffrage Club, an African American women’s club, wrote this sympathy note
                (above) to Fannie Wilson on the death of her husband.

                African American obituaries saved by Wilson's daughter, Gwendolyn Wilson Fowler, show that African
                American women in the <b>1900s</b> were involved in suffrage clubs and, later, the League of Women Voters.

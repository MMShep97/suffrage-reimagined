        <div>Women’s clubs exploded into existence in the latter half of the nineteenth century and were extremely important to the suffrage movement.</div>
        <div>Some, such as the Charles City Political Equality Club, were devoted almost solely to getting the vote. Others, such as the Proteus Club of Des Moines and the Cary Club of Marion, were focused on intellectual and community improvement. These clubs provided an established network of active women ripe for conversion to the suffrage cause.</div>
        <div>In 1907, IESA officers lived in cities and towns across the state, including Chariton, Des Moines, Hull, Ida Grove, Mason City, Maquoketa, Ottumwa, Panora, Sheldon, Shenandoah, and Sioux City. Map created by Christine Mastalio.</div>
        <div>In July 1912, Iowa suffragists staged an automobile tour from Des Moines to Highland Park, Valley Junction, and Mitchellville. They would arrive at a stop, play cornets to announce their arrival and then give speeches.</div>
        <div>Another automobile tour was launched in September 1913, going from central Iowa to the eastern border. An estimated 7,500 people in 30 towns saw the mobile caravan.

        <div>In 1909, her husband, Iowa Senator George Cosson, supported a bill to give women the vote. The bill was quickly killed.</div>

            This 1897 sheet music dedicated to the Political Equality Club of Emmetsburg, Iowa details, in song, why Iowa women should vote.

        <div>Composer Lilla Cordelia Ormsby Bliven moved to Palo Alto County, Iowa from Michigan in the 1880s with her husband, Charles Bliven. Lilla Bliven wrote verses and songs for almost every occasion, according to her son Bruce Bliven’s reminiscences in the August 1968 edition of The <h1>NEEDS LINK</h1>Palimpsest.</div>
        <div>In 1913, the Proteus Club of Des Moines put on a fundraising event. Their play, “The Militant Husbandette,” spoofed Molière's work by parodying activities of militant British suffragettes.</div>
        <div>The Iowa Federation of Women’s Clubs (IFWC) organized in 1893 and provided organizational support and ideas for hundreds of clubs by the 1920s. During this time period, middle-class women had both increased leisure time and increased education resulting in a proliferation of women’s clubs focused on just about everything including education, conservation, philanthropy, civic duties, social causes and intellectual improvement.</div>
        <div>In 1911, the IFWC became one of the first state federations to endorse suffrage.</div>
        <div>Carrie Dean graduated from Tipton, Iowa high school in 1895 and moved to Ida Grove, Iowa after her marriage in the early 1900s. Once there, she joined the Ida Grove Civic Club, which she remembered in her 1936 reminiscences as a suffrage club that disguised its name to appeal to conservative sensibilities.</div>
        <div>In addition to suffrage activities, the club also worked to get a new library, high school, golf course and swimming pool in Ida Grove.</div>
        <div>Sixteen years after Iowa women began voting, Carrie Pruyn recalled touring the rural areas around Ida Grove in her Buick, which she had decorated with suffrage slogans, and arguing with farmers who wanted the women to go back home and take care of the babies.</div>
        <div>Although rural males made up 70 percent of Iowa’s voting population, it was not until the 1910s that the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association began focusing on educating rural voters.</div>

            <div>From <b>1890 to 1915</b>, Iowans witnessed a changing of the guard in the suffrage movement as early
                leaders aged or died. In many cases, younger women brought fresh hope and ideas to the cause.</div>
            <div>By this time, many womenâ€™s clubs were discussing and debating suffrage. In <b>1894</b>, Iowa women were
                granted partial suffrage to vote on bond issues and questions of tax increases for schools or
                municipalities, but, nationally, women were making slow gains.</div>
            <div>In <b>1908</b>, Boone, Iowa hosted one of the first suffrage parades in the nation.</div>
            <div>Jennifer Riggs (Cosson) wrote several essays and speeches while at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa.
                She argued publicly for suffrage, but did so within the context of <b>1890s</b> social mores.</div>
            <div>Cosson was eloquent in her defense of the rights of women to be involved in society and in politics,
                but was not always comfortable with militant methods such as parades or picketing. She also was not sure
                that women had enough education to handle the responsibilities that came with voting.</div>
            <div>In <b>1909</b>, her husband, Iowa Senator George Cosson, supported a bill to give women the vote. The bill was
                quickly killed.</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1869 - 1896: </b>Wyoming became the first state to grant suffrage in <b>1869.</b> Seven
                        states followed, granting at least partial suffrage.</li>
                    <li><b>1897 - 1910: </b>No U.S. state suffrage referendum was successful.</li>
                    <li><b>By 1915: </b>Eight more states or territories had at least partial suffrage.</li>
                    <li><b>1887 - 1914: </b>A federal amendment granting women the right to vote remained dormant.</li>
                    <li><b>1914: </b>Congress reconsidered a federal amendment to grant equal suffrage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>By <b>1900</b>, Iowa was one of four states with antisuffrage committees organized by women. These women may
                have feared the changes that suffrage would bring, believing they already had influence without official
                titles or legal rights.</div>
            <div>Of course, Iowa also had organized antisuffragist campaigns led by men. In <b>1916</b>, the Iowa Association
                of Men Opposed to Woman Suffrage formed. Its members included a former Iowa governor, a real estate
                tycoon and railroad president, oil company lawyers, and a Ford Auto executive.</div>

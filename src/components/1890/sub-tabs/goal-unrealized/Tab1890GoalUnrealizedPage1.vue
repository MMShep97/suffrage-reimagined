            <div>Known as “The Mother of Woman Suffrage in Iowa,” Mary Jane Whitely Coggeshall paid tribute to the
                sacrifices of Susan B. Anthony in a 1906 Des Moines Political Equality Club memorial. Five years later,
                Coggeshall died without realizing her goal of equal suffrage.</div>

                        the right to vote on a bond issue. The arguments in the case would be used to justify

            <div>Despite unrealized goals, suffragists seemed to be optimistic that victory was right around the corner.
                In an 1898 suffrage report for the Iowa Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), Martha Callanan
                wrote, “...it would seem as if public sentiment would not much longer tolerate the withholding of this
                justice to one half the people.”</div>
            <div>
                By 1915, the Iowa legislature had approved a ballot measure to amend the Iowa constitution and grant
                women full suffrage. In June 1916 the referendum failed, and IESA women continued to hope for an end to
                the “wait full of woe.”

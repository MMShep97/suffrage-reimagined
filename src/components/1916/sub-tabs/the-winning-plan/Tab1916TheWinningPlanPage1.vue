        <div class="text-left">
            <div>The failed 1916 referendum in Iowa spurred Carrie Chapman Catt, serving her second term as 
                president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, to devise a four-pronged strategy,
                 which would later be known as “The Winning Plan.”</div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Women in states with presidential suffrage would work to pass a federal suffrage amendment</li>
                    <li>Women who believed they could successfully amend their state constitution would press for a referendum</li>
                    <li>Most states would work toward presidential suffrage</li>
                    <li>Southern states would work toward primary suffrage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>Iowa women won presidential suffrage in April 1919.</div>
            <div>On July 2, 1919 Iowa became the tenth State to ratify the federal amendment. In a special session, 
                the House voted 96 to 5 in favor; the Senate passed it unanimously 45 to 0. On August 26, 
                1920 Tennessee became the thirty-sixth state to ratify - enacting the Nineteenth Amendment to the 
                Constitution.</div>
            <div>“This is jubilee day. This is glory day. I am so happy to be here tonight to tell you about the 
                long trail, - the Suffrage trail, the wonderful trail that has led us up and up, - until today women
                 are free,” Alice Longley, Des Moines Political Equality Club, Polk County, Iowa, 1920.</div>

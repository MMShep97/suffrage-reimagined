        <div class="text-left">
            <div>Iowa’s referendum attracted fierce anti-suffrage attention. One of the most active ‘anti’ organizations, 
                the Iowa Association of Men Opposed to Woman Suffrage, was led by former Iowa governor Frank D. Jackson.</div>
            <div>Suffragists blamed the liquor industry, the German American Alliance, and ignorant rural voters for 
                their defeat in the 1916 referendum. Opposition to prohibition and women’s suffrage often went 
                hand-in-hand, because the liquor industry feared women would enact prohibition. 
                The German American Alliance probably did not exist as a formal organization, although many new immigrants, 
                including those from Germany, did hold conservative views of woman’s role in society. 
                Community size had virtually no correlation with how a man voted for equal suffrage.</div>
            <div>In general, the greatest opposition to the 1916 referendum came from the wet counties on the eastern 
                edge of the state and counties that had heavy concentrations of non-English immigrants, Catholics, or Democrats.</div>
            <div>A Woman’s Christian Temperance Union investigation published in January 1917 concluded that the 
                referendum was rife with fraud. Far more ballots were cast on the suffrage measure than in the 
                gubernatorial election held at the same time. Many counties violated election laws by having 
                improperly trained officials, improperly placed ballot boxes, and improperly recorded tallies. 
                In some counties, the number of votes cast exceeded the number of names registered to vote!</div>

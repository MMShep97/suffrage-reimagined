        <div class="text-left scrapbook-content-container">
            <div><b>June 5, 1916</b> was judgment day for the suffrage amendment. Thanks to the hard work of the Iowa 
                Equal Suffrage Association and its able leaders, Mary Safford <b>(1912 - 1913)</b> and Flora Dunlap <b>(1913 - 1916)</b>, 
                the Iowa General Assembly had finally passed a proposed constitutional amendment in 
                two consecutive sessions. Now it would be up to the people.</div>
            <div>The women of the state (and some men) mobilized in full force to convince voting men to check ‘yes’ 
                on a special ballot. Clubs spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, on campaign literature, lecturers, 
                and another state automobile tour.</div>
            <div>The IESA’s <b>1915</b> plan for the months leading up to the election called for fundraising, “directly through 
                collections at meetings or solicitations of contributions; indirectly through food sales, bazaars, 
                banquets, suffrage plays, entertainments or by any other method that fits the community.”</div>
            <div>Between <b>1910 and 1916</b>, nineteen out of twenty-six suffrage referenda in the United States were defeated. 
                The track record in the forty years before that was even worse.</div>
            <div>Iowa suffragists knew they had a fight ahead of them - especially in light of vigorous anti-suffrage 
                campaigns organizing around the referendum. Suffrage supporters viewed their biggest foes as immigrants, 
                rural voters, and the liquor industry.</div>

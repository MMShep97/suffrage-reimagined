        <div class="text-left">
            <div>Even as they celebrated, the members of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association (IESA) 
                began planning for a new nonpartisan organization dedicated to political and 
                civic education: the League of Women Voters of Iowa (LWV).</div>
            <div>At the final convention of the IESA in 1919 President Pauline Devitt spoke of 
                the new role they would play, educating women voters and encouraging them to 
                exercise their newly-won right: “We are here, women of this convention, 
                to cast off the grave clothes and try our unaccustomed wings over new fields of action.”</div>
            <div>In the 1920s, the Iowa LWV sent state organizers to various communities 
                to educate women about the political process and current issues.</div> 
            <div>Local LWV organizations began to spring up across the state; more than 
                100 women attended an organizing meeting in Osage, Iowa in 1924.</div>
            <div>Iowa women continued to be active on the national stage and to 
                have close ties with women’s organizations elsewhere.</div>
            <div>In 1923, the National League of Women Voters held its convention in
                 Des Moines, bringing national attention and business to the area.</div>

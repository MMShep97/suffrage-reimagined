            <div>A Note on Sources</div>
            <div>In addition to the primary sources selected for the Women's Suffrage in 
                Iowa Digital Collection, Christine Mastalio and Kayla Pollock consulted many 
                secondary sources to create the text for this exhibit. Some of the most 
                helpful were Louise Noun's Strong-Minded Women and Sara Egge's dissertation 
                (for Iowa information) and books by Sara Evans and Eleanor Flexner (for national context).</div>
            <br/>
            <div>Exhibit Image Index</div>
            <div>The Image Index includes a citation for each image included in the exhibit. 
                Each citation links directly to its corresponding digital object.</div>

            <div>Further Resources on Suffrage in Iowa</div>
            <div>The resources page provides a bibliography of dozens of primary and secondary sources 
                relating to women’s suffrage in Iowa including archival collections, books, 
                journal articles, and websites.</div>

            <div>Guide to the Physical Collections</div>
            <div>Items selected for the Women’s Suffrage in Iowa Digital Collection often were a 
                small portion of much larger collections. This guide provides the larger context 
                for the digital objects by describing the physical collections from which they were selected.</div>

            <div>"One Century is Long Enough to Wait for Equity"</div>
            <div>One organization continuing the fight for political equality in the twenty-first century is 50/50 in 2020.</div>
            <div>Founded by former Iowa senators Jean Lloyd Jones (D- Iowa City) and Maggie Tinsman (R-Davenport), 
                “The mission of 50-50 in 2020 is to achieve political equity for Iowa women by recruiting, 
                training, and mentoring women in sufficient numbers that by the 100th anniversary of 
                Woman Suffrage (the year 2020) Iowans will have elected females to fill 50% of the Iowa
                 Legislature, the Iowa delegation of the U.S. Congress, and the office of the Governor.”</div>
            <div>The Iowa Commission on the Status of Women and the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women 
                in Politics also provide current resources on women in politics.</div>
